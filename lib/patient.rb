# The Patient class needs an instance method, #new_appointment, that takes in an argument of a doctor and a date and creates a new Appointment. The Appointment should know that it belongs to the patient.
# The Patient class needs an instance method, #appointments, that iterates through the Appointments array and returns Appointments that belong to the patient.
# The Patient class needs an instance method, #doctors, that iterates over that patient's Appointments and collects the doctor that belongs to each Appointment.
